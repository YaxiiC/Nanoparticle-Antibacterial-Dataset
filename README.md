# Nanoparticle Antibacterial Dataset

This repository aggregates experimentally validated datasets of antibacterial nanoparticles drawn from 98 peer-reviewed studies. Each entry couples nanoparticle physicochemical descriptors with bacterial characteristics and minimum inhibitory/bactericidal concentration (MIC/MBC) outcomes, enabling machine learning analyses of nanoparticle efficacy.

## Dataset Highlights
- **Comprehensive feature coverage:** size, shape, surface charge, synthesis route, and other nanoparticle attributes alongside bacterial Gram type, morphology, and oxygen requirement.
- **Multiple learning tasks:** regression targets for MIC and MBC, plus a MIC classification label for categorical performance assessment.
- **Model-ready format:** curated CSV files (`Nanoparticles_MIC.csv`, `Nanoparticles_MBC.csv`, `Nanoparticles_MIC_with_class.csv`) prepared for supervised learning pipelines.
